// Task

// You are given two number variables a and b. Both of them have been declared and assigned.

// Your task is to :

// Create a variable add and assign it with the summation of a and b.
// Create a variable sub and assign it with the subtraction of b from a.
// Create a variable mul and assign it with the multiplication of a and b.
// Create a variable div and assign it with the division of a by b.
// Create a variable inc and assign it with the incremented value of a.
// Create a variable dec and assign it with the decremented value of b.

//Do not declare variables `a` and `b`.
//Write your code below this line.
var add = a + b;
var sub = a - b;
var mul = a * b;
var div = a / b;

// Create a variable inc and assign it with the incremented value of a
a++;
var inc = a;

// Create a variable dec and assign it with the decremented value of b
b--;
var dec = b;
